#Asteroid Orbit Determination

This uses the Method of Gauss specifically from 3 Right Ascensions, Declinations, Times and Sun-Earth vectors to compute the Position and Velocity vector of the second observation

This is used to calculate the orbital elements as follows:
a = semi-major axis
e = eccentricity
i = inclination
OMEGA = longitude of ascending node
omega = argument of perihelion
T = time of perihelion passage
