#Asteroid Orbit Determination

This uses the Method of Gauss specifically from 3 Right Ascensions, Declinations, Times and Sun-Earth vectors to compute the Position and Velocity vector of the second observation

This is used to calculate the orbital elements as follows:
a = semi-major axis
e = eccentricity
i = inclination
OMEGA = longitude of ascending node
omega = argument of perihelion
T = time of perihelion passage

Contents of this repository:
1. Images collected from the University of Colorado Boulder's 20-inch telescopes
2. Overall Orbit Determination Code that takes in three specific inputs of the asteroid's coordinates at different times to determine the trajectory
3. 50-million year gravitational simulation using the Rebound library
4. Final Report analysing and explaining the results in LaTeX
